# Setup Eslint, Prettier and Pre-commit hooks with Husky for a ReactJS Project with VSCode from scratch.


__Eslint -__ [Eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/Javascript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

__Prettier -__ [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) is an opinionated code formatter that ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

__Pre-commit -__ [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a git hook that is useful for identifying issues before code submission. We use pre-commit here to check code format with `Eslint` and `Prettier` rules that we set in the configuration file.
